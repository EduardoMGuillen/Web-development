As Director, Roger blends decades of family legacy with a modern vision for inclusive, values-driven athletics. His journey began in the 1970s, when his parents opened a local sports complex&mdash;planting the seeds of a lifelong commitment to youth development through play.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">During the COVID-19 pandemic, Roger saw a critical need: children were losing access to physical activity, social connection, and character-building experiences. In response, he launched NZone Sports CenTex, a youth sports organization dedicated to offering affordable, high-energy sports programs for kids of all backgrounds. Today, the organization serves over 2,000 children annually, offering soccer, volleyball, basketball, cheerleading, and more&mdash;all designed to teach teamwork, leadership, resilience, and many other skill sets.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">After a couple of seasons of play, and many kids and families not able to participate because of cost, Roger Guerrero founded </span><span class="c0">Go Play Sports Inc.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;with a heartfelt mission: to make youth sports accessible to all children, especially those from income-restricted families. His inspiration stems from a deeply personal place&mdash;his upbringing in San Antonio, Texas, where his family was immersed in the local sports scene. In fact, his parents opened a sports park in southeast San Antonio back in 1977.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Growing up surrounded by sports and mentored by his older siblings, Roger developed a strong belief in the transformative power of athletics. He saw firsthand how sports could build confidence, leadership, teamwork, and resilience. That belief became the foundation of Go Play Sports. His goal is to </span><span class="c0">level the playing field</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;by removing financial barriers that prevent kids from participating in sports, giving every child the chance to &ldquo;Unplug and Have Fun&rdquo; and &ldquo;Get Out and Play&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Roger&rsquo;s approach is holistic: sports are not just games, but tools for life. He&rsquo;s implemented l scholarships, volunteer opportunities, and family-centric events like &ldquo;parents vs. kids&rdquo; games to ensure every child feels seen, supported, and safe. His mission is clear&mdash;combat screen time, promote healthy habits, and build a village where every child can thrive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">It&rsquo;s not just about games&mdash;it&rsquo;s about giving kids the tools to thrive. Pretty powerful stuff.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c3"></span></p></body></html>
